Structural nonlinear seismic time-history response prediction of urban-scale reinforced concrete frames based on deep learning


The model proposed in this paper can simultaneously consider the diversity of structural parameters and ground motions. The trained model is applicable to low-rise and mid-rise RC frame structures with different seismic design intensities, floor heights, and plan dimensions. This is the most significant difference compared to the existing studies.
